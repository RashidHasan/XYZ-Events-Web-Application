## Project Idea

### Objective
XYZ Events, a renowned event management company, aims to create an EMS that enhances their event planning capabilities, improves efficiency, and provides exceptional value to clients. The goal is to develop a user-friendly web application that facilitates the seamless organization and management of various events, ranging from conferences to social gatherings and festivals.

### Key Features
- **User-friendly Interface:** The EMS will feature an intuitive navigation bar and footer to ensure easy navigation for users.
- **Organizer Account Creation:** Organizers can create accounts by providing essential information such as name, email, and phone number.
- **Event Management:** Organizers can create new events with detailed specifications like event name, date, location, capacity, and description. The system will display a comprehensive list of all available events to help avoid scheduling conflicts.
- **Attendee Registration and Ticketing:** Attendees can register by entering their personal details, choose their desired event from the list, and select a ticket type along with its associated price. The system will manage attendee information efficiently, ensuring each attendee is correctly linked to their respective event.
